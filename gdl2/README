Currently the gdl2 testsuite requires multiple runs to test multiple adaptors
by default it attempts to run with the 'PostgreSQL' adaptor.

The adaptor can be set in 2 ways.
From the toplevel testsuite directory:

TEST_ADAPTOR="PostgreSQL" ./runtests.sh gdl2
TEST_ADAPTOR="SQLite3" ./runtests.sh gdl2

Additionally you can change the default adaptor with

defaults write NSGlobalDomain GDL2TestAdaptorName 'SQLite3'
./runtests.sh gdl2

Some adaptors may require set up of a database,
for the PostgreSQL adaptor you'll need a writable database
named 'gdl2test'

so you'll need to run 
createdb gdl2test

the SQLite3 adaptor will automatically create a database
/tmp/gdl2test.

Sometimes, either because of a testsuite failure or because the user canceled
a test mid-run, you may need to delete the database, for instance
the testsuite may attempt to create tables which already exist.

SQLite3:
rm /tmp/gdl2test

PostgreSQL:
dropdb gdl2test
createdb gdl2test

Ideally we would like to have the tests run dynamically with all available
adaptors in a single run. So this can be considered an interim solution.

Running the testsuite with third party EOAdaptors is not supported,
you will at least need to add prototypes for the adaptor
to TSTTradingModel.eomodeld.
