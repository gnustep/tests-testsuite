Testsuite

This testsuite is a general framework for testing the core GNUstep
libraries.

Please get the latest gnustep-make from subversion and install it in order
to get the gnustep-tests program to run the tests.

Please run this testsuite often, when adding new features, fixing bugs
and running on new platforms.
