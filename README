Testsuite
=========

This testsuite is a general framework for testing the core GNUstep
libraries. Since we are testing the very basic level of an Objective-C
runtime, we can't use more complete unit tests, such as OCUnit
<http://www.sente.ch/software/ocunit/>, although we recommend proper
unit tests for higher-level applications and libraries.

Please run this testsuite often, when adding new features, fixing bugs
and running on new platforms.

copyright by the FSF, but retain the copyright of the original owner
(e.g tests submited as bug reports). You should feel free to add tests
that are not copyright by the FSF. The copyright of these tests should
be clearly stated, however, they should still be distributed under the
GPL.

Running Tests
-------------

To run a testsuite, use the runtests.sh script along with the name of
the project testsuite you with to test:

./runtests.sh base

If you compiled the libraries with debug=yes, make sure to add the
--debug argument:

./runtests.sh --debug base

You can also run parts of a testsuite like:

./runtests.sh /base/NSFileManager

or specific test blocks like:

./runtests.sh /base/NSFileManager/general.m
